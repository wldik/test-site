    <h1>The reddest cat ever</h1>
    <img src="images\test-image-cat.jpg" alt="Red cat's sleeping" />
    <p>In a quirky corner of the world where absurdity reigns supreme, there resides a red cat named Sir Fluffington III (Vermillion for short). This feline luminary dons a fur coat that could outshine a cherry on a sunny day and struts through life with an air of nonchalance that makes philosophers question their life's purpose. Sir Fluffington's exploration of absurdism takes the form of uproarious scenarios:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> His idea of hunting involves stealthily stalking dust bunnies that he believes are plotting to take over the world, engaging in epic battles that only end when he gets distracted by a sunbeam. Who knew dust could be so diabolical?</li>
        <li>This crimson connoisseur often hosts high-brow soir√©es for his stuffed toy entourage, debating the existence of the elusive "purrpose" of life while sipping on pretend tea and demanding deeper conversations from his teddy bear guests.</li>
        <li>In a world where conversations with inanimate objects are considered peculiar, Sir Fluffington is the kingpin. He debates with lamp posts about the best strategy for catching moonbeams and shares philosophical musings with potted plants about the nature of photosynthesis. Rumor has it that the mailbox once gave him sage advice on bird-watching.</li>
      </ul>      
    <p>In this topsy-turvy realm, Sir Fluffington's crimson fur stands as a beacon of hilarity, painting the town with strokes of absurdity that leave everyone amused, confounded, and slightly envious of his carefree, whimsical ways.
